/**
 * A2A Agent Card builder - current spec (A2A v1.0, Linux Foundation, 2026).
 *
 * Primary endpoint: /.well-known/agent-card.json. /.well-known/agent.json is
 * kept as a byte-identical backward-compat alias (Google ADK and tooling built
 * against the earlier draft still read it). Both routes import this one builder,
 * so there is nothing to keep in sync.
 *
 * v1.0 shape baked in below:
 * - camelCase field names.
 * - `securitySchemes` + `security` (OpenAPI 3 shape) instead of the old
 *   `authentication.schemes`. This is a public, read-only agent, so both are
 *   empty (`security: []` = "no requirements").
 * - `protocolVersion`, `preferredTransport`, `provider`.
 * - Signed Agent Cards (JWS, v1.0 trust feature) intentionally omitted -
 *   unsigned by design until signing infra exists (see README).
 *
 * `baseUrl` is read from Astro's `site` at build time.
